# studymatchdart
A study matching app for students at Dartmouth

# StudyMatch 🎓

**Category:** Campus Life / Academic Support  
**Submission:** BuildWithClaude @ Dartmouth

## Problem
Dartmouth students often struggle to find classmates studying the same course or section at the same time.  
Group chats get noisy, and scheduling is hard — especially across majors and time zones.

## Solution
StudyMatch connects students in **the same class or section** who share:
- Same course (e.g. “CS1”, “MATH3”)  
- Same professor / section  
- Similar study style (“quiet” vs. “talk”)  
- Overlapping availability  

Built with **Python + Streamlit**, it runs locally or on the web in one click.

## ⚙️ Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run studymatch.py
